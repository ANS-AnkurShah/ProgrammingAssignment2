## The first function will create a special matrix with functions to retrieve 
## and set the value of the matrix and its associated inverse.

## This function creates a list of functions to retrieve and modify a matrix
## that is received as its argument.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function returns the inverse of a matrix if it has not been previously
## calculated. Otherwise, it justs retrieves the previously calculated value.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data)
  x$setInverse(i)
  i
}
