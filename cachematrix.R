Two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and cache's its mean .
  

## Write a short comment describing this function
## assigns object a value different from current environment

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        

}



## calculates the mean and places it in setmean function unless it is already calculated then it will get the mean from the cache
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
       
}
