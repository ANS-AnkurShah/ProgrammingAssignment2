## I am completely stumped at what to do to complete this project!!!   
## I have tried for a week to understand what function(s) to write - but to no avail.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
