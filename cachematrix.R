## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

## this will convert the X vector into matrix form, which will have to pass the X <- c( 1,2,3,4), nrows=2,ncol=2)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        solve(x) # solve function will give the inverse of matrix.
}
