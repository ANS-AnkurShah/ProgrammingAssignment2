## I have created a function named "makeCacheMatrix" which will accept x as matrix from user
## Then it set the value of matrix and get the value of matrix
## Then it set the value of inverse and get the value of inverse.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) { 
    inv <- NULL                             ## initialize inv as NULL; will hold value of matrix inverse 
    set <- function(y) {                    ## define the set function to assign new 
        x <<- y                             ## value of matrix in parent environment
        inv <<- NULL                        ## if there is a new matrix, reset inv to NULL
    }
    get <- function() x                     

    setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse  ## assigns value of inv in parent environment
    getinverse <- function() inv                     ## gets the value of inv where called
    list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse) 
}


## The function cacheSolve takes the output from makeCacheMatrix(matrix) as an 
# input and checks inverse matrix from makeCacheMatrix(matrix) has any value in it or not.
# In case inverse matrix from makeCacheMatrix((matrix) is empty, it gets the original matrix data from 
# and set the invertible  matrix by using the solve function.
# In case inverse matrix from makeCacheMatrix((matrix) has some value in it (always works
#after running the code 1st time), it returns a message  "Getting Cached Invertible Matrix" 
#and the cached object

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
   invMatrix <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(invMatrix)) {                       #if inverse matrix is not NULL
    message("Getting Cached Invertible Matrix")   #Type message: Getting Cached Invertible Matrix 
    return(invMatrix)                             #return the invertible matrix
  }

  #if value of the invertible matrix is NULL then  
  MatrixData <- x$getMatrix()                     #get the original Matrix Data 
  invMatrix <- solve(MatrixData, ...)             #use solve function to inverse the matrix
  x$setInverse(invMatrix)                         #set the invertible matrix 
  return(invMatrix)    
}
