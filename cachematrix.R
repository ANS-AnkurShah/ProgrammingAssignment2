## This was an assignment to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.
## By the time we were studing ways to avoid repeating costly computations by caching.
## than compute it repeatedly.



## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# It is a list contining a function to 
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of the inverse
# 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}



## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
# "makeCacheMatrix". If the inverse has already been calculated (and the
# matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse
# from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
