## Invert a matrix and cache its result, so subsequent requests for matrix inversion
## retrieve from cache rather than redoing the inversion calculation

## makeCacheMatrix() - create a cache for a matrix 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve() invert a matrix, or retrieve from cache if it already exists

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
