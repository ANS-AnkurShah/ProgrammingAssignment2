## Write a short comment describing this function

##Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object
##that stores a matrix and caches its inverse.
## This function creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

##This functoin computes the inverse of the special 'matrix' created by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
## then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
