## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## Two functions to create: a) special matrix. b) its invers in capable of  
## caching the invers and retrive it when need it.
## 
## These functions was created for Programming Assignment 2:

##

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}




## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
