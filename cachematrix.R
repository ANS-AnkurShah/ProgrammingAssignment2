## THe perpose of this R function is to calculate the inverse of a square matrix and cache it so that it can be used lateron from the cache.
## function makeCacheMatrix creates a special "Matrix", which containins the functions to 
## set the value of the Matrix
## get the value of the Matrix
## set the value of the inverse of the Matrix
## get the value of the inverse of the Matrix
##
## The acheSolve function calculates the inverse of the special "Matrix" created with the above function. However, 
##        it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. 
##                If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, 
##        it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

akeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
