## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
#write a pair of functions that cache the inverts of a matrix

## functions do

## Write a short comment describing this function
#1. makeCacheMatrix <- create special matrix object that caches the inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
#2. cacheSolve: computes the inverse of the special matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix

#if inverse calculated (no change in matrix), then cachesolve should retrieve the inverse of thde cache
#inverse of a square matrix **solve function
#if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(x) returns its inverse
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
