## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the matrix
## 4. get the value of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The following function calculates the mean of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m
}
