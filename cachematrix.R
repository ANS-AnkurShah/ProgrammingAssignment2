## Write a short comment describing this function
This function is prompt to skip computation and accelerate processes. In this function we set the inverse of it self. To do it it has to be a squared matrix and its determinant has to be different of zero.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()nrow= 2, ncol=2) { x^-1 <<- cacheSolve

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
Cache solve returns the inverse of the function ()x  if and only if x is squared.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {if x is ^2 returns inverse matrix, else returns NA vallue
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
