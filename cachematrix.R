## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

#Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
#(there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
#Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

#makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
#cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 

## Write a short comment describing this function
#The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "Matrix", which is really a list containing a function to

#set the value of the Matrix
#get the value of the Matrix
#set the Inverse of the Matrix
#get the Inverse of the Matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
