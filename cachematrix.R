## In this example I introduce the <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object 
## in an environment that is different from the current environment. Below are two functions that are used to
## create a special object that stores a numeric matrix and cache's its inverse.

## The first function, makeVector creates a special "matrixr", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the vector
## get the value of the vector
## set the value of the mean
## get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL 
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}

## The next function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
