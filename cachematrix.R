## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## 1. Starting with the example of cache form the assignment,
##    I change the mean computation to solve.
## 2. Utilizing the !is.null in the cacheSolve, it will pull the
##    data ONLY when m is null, so in essence if I run:
##    
##    solve(matrix(1)) 
##    
##    It will take longer than if I run
##
##    cacheSolve(makeCacheMatrix(1))
##    
##    


## Write a short comment describing this function

## Upon declaring and running the makeCacheMatrix, the data in m
## is stored into variable. 
## The cacheSolve take advantage of the lexical scoping by checking
## the enviroment for m. Eventhough m is not part of the cacheSolve, 
## it is available for reading in the enviroment.
