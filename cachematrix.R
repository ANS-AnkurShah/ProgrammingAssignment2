## The following pair of functions cache the inverse of a matrix

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	## Create a special matrix object

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by the "makeCacheMatrix" function described above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated and the matrix has not been changed,
## then cacheSolve retrieves the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
	## Create an inverse of the cached matrix
}
